      <p className="my-3">
        By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to
        you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before
        using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of
        the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
        extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to
        translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The
        app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and
        other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Orenji
        Team.
      </p>
      <p className="my-3">
        Orenji Team is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and
        efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make
        changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for
        any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without
        making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
      </p>
      <p className="my-3">
        The Orenji app stores and processes personal data that you have provided
        to us, to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your
        phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
        not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing
        software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating
        system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
        malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security
        features and it could mean that the Orenji app won’t work properly or at
        all.
      </p>
      <p className="my-3">
        The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and
        Conditions.
      </p>
      <p className="my-3">
        You should be aware that there are certain things that Orenji Team will
        not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require
        the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be
        Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Orenji Team
        cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality
        if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
        allowance left.
      </p>
      <p className="my-3">
        If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
        remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network
        provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
        mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection
        while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app,
        you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming
        data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.
        region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the
        bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware
        that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for
        using the app.
      </p>{" "}
      <p className="my-3">
        Along the same lines, Orenji Team cannot always take responsibility for
        the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device
        stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to
        avail the Service, Orenji Team cannot accept responsibility.
      </p>{" "}
      <p className="my-3">
        With respect to Orenji Team’s responsibility for your use of the app,
        when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although
        we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
        rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make
        it available to you. Orenji Team accepts no liability for any loss,
        direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
        functionality of the app.
      </p>{" "}
      <p className="my-3">
        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
        available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for the both
        systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
        availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the
        updates if you want to keep using the app. Orenji Team does not promise
        that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or
        works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have installed on your
        device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application
        when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may
        terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to
        you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights
        and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop
        using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
